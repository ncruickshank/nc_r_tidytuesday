For this week, I wanted to look at the timeline of NBER publications by program. The cells on each timeline in the y-axis are filled using the magma viridis scale, associated with total papers published that year (ranges 0 - 400ish). The term at the start of each decade represents the most distinct term for that decade within each program. This serves as a big picture glimpse at how the interests within the field has changed over the years.
