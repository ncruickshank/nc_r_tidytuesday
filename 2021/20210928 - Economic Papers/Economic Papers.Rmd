# Introduction

This weeks [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-09-28) project focuses on data from the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www2.nber.org/RePEc/nbr/nberwo/) and the [`nberwp` package by Ben Davies](https://github.com/bldavies/nberwp).

> New research by NBER affiliates, circulated for discussion and comment. The NBER distributes more than 1,200 working papers each year. These papers have not been peer reviewed. Papers issued more than 18 months ago are open access. More recent papers are available without charge to affiliates of subscribing academic institutions, employees of NBER Corporate Associates, government employees in the US, journalists, and residents of low-income countries.
