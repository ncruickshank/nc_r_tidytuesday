Head of summary table

Which season had the greatest disparity between viewers at premier vs at
finale?

``` r
# identify what the top five countries are for filling the graph
list_top5_countries <- head(arrange(count(summary, vars = country), desc(n)), 5)$vars

# reshape summary by country with "Other" category
sum_pie_df <- summary %>%
  mutate(
    country_category = ifelse(country %in% list_top5_countries, country, "Other")
  ) %>%
  group_by(country_category) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(value = n())

# colors to use by country
countries_colors <- c(
  "Brazil" = "limegreen",
  "Fiji" = "deepskyblue",
  "Nicaragua" = "royalblue",
  "Other" = "gray50",
  "Panama" = "red",
  "Philippines" = "gold"
)

# create plots
## pie chart and legen
sum_pie <- ggplot(sum_pie_df, aes(x = "", y = value, fill = country_category)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "gray20") + 
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = countries_colors) + 
  labs(title = "Location Breakdown", fill = "Country") +
  theme_void() +

## viewership delta

    country_category = ifelse(country %in% list_top5_countries, country, "Other")
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, viewer_delta)) +

Looks like overall mean viewership declined throughout the seasons (no
surprise). Also, the variance in the delta between viewers at finale and
viewers at premiere dropped off over time. I interpret this as
demonstrating that the people who watched the later seasons of the show
were already enfranchised, and were thus more likely to commit to
finishing the season once started.

``` r
repeat_winners <- filter(count(summary, vars = full_name), n > 1)$vars
seasons_with_returns <- nrow(filter(summary, str_detect(tribe_setup, "(returning|past)")))
```

Looking at the winners from each season, it is clear that there were
only two repeat winners: Sandra Diaz-Twine, Tony Vlachos.

Of the 40 seasons of Survivor, there were 12 seasons where returning
players were allowed. From those 12 emerged 2 repeat winners: Sandra
Diaz-Twine, Tony Vlachos.

Head of challenges table

Nothing here really interests me. Maybe could join this table with
another to see relationships between `challenge type` and some other
metrics (e.g.Â viewers, ratings, castaway personality type, etc).
However, there are only two challenge types, both of which seem
relatively evenly distributed. Specifically, there are 2535 reward
challenges and 2488 immnity challenges.

### Age by Season

``` r
castaways_sum <- castaways %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    players = n_distinct(full_name),
    mode_personality = Mode(personality_type),
    min_age = min(age),
    mean_age = mean(age),
    max_age = max(age)
  )
```

``` r
castaways %>%
  ggplot(aes(season, age)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = season)) +
  labs(
    title = "Survivor: Distribution of castaway ages throughout the seasons",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Age"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )
```

![](Tidy-Tuesday-20210601---SURVIVOR_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

For the above boxplot, it is possible to assign color of the graph to
season rating or viewers. However, this would be substantially
confounded by the fact that both factors went down over time. At that
point, it would be plotting two different mesaures (season by age, and
season by viewers), and potentially suggesting a false causality.
Therefore, this was not done.

### Result by Personality Type

  dplyr::summarise(
    `Percent of castaways who won the season` = 100*(sum(result == "Sole Survivor") / n()),
    `Percent of castaways who were finalists (winners and runner-ups)` = 100*(sum(str_detect(str_to_lower(result), "(runner-up|sole survivor)")) / n()),
    `Staying Power (sum of order squared, divided by count)` = sum(order^2) / n(),
  )

personality_success_plot <- castaway_personality %>%
