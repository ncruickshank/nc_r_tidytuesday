# Introduction

This weeks [Tidy Tuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-08-24) focuses on Lemurs! The data is made available by the [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/). 

## About Lemurs and the Duke Lemur Center

> The [Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/) houses over 200 lemurs across 14 species – the most diverse population of lemurs on Earth, outside their native Madagascar.
>
> Lemurs are the most threatened group of mammals on the planet, and 95% of lemur species are at risk of extinction. Our mission is to learn everything we can about lemurs – because the more we learn, the better we can work to save them from extinction. They are endemic only to Madagascar, so it’s essentially a one-shot deal: once lemurs are gone from Madagascar, they are gone from the wild.
>
> By studying the variables that most affect their health, reproduction, and social dynamics, the Duke Lemur Center learns how to most effectively focus their conservation efforts. And the more we learn about lemurs, the better we can educate the public around the world about just how amazing these animals are, why they need to be protected, and how each and every one of us can make a difference in their survival.

## Article by Zehr et al 2014

> Here we present verified data for 3,627 individuals of 27 taxa in the form of a life history table containing summarized species values for variables relating to ancestry, reproduction, longevity, and body mass

> The current colony size is maintained at roughly 250 animals with 11 actively breeding species, and is the largest diverse collection of captive strepsirrhines worldwide. The endangered status of the species in the collection3, combined with regulations supporting their protection in the wild, make it extremely unlikely that a colony of this magnitude and diversity could ever be re-created.

> We have generated a life history table that provides species data and summary statistics for variables relating to adult, young-adult, and neonatal body mass, birth and breeding season, litter size, age at reproduction, longevity, infant mortality, [and] activity pattern

## Average Litter Size By Taxon

Had to remind myself to count the number of _distinct_ `dlc_id` with the same dam as their mother. Otherwise the resulting output thinks there are hundreds of offspring for lemur. If that were the case, this species wouldn't exactly be extinct!

```{r Distribution of Total Offspring, fig.height=14, fig.width=4}
# number of siblings (shared mother)
litter_size_plot <- lemurs %>%
  inner_join(taxon_map, by = "taxon") %>%
  filter(birth_institution == "Duke Lemur Center") %>%
  group_by(taxon, common_name, dam_id) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    male = n_distinct(dlc_id[sex == "M"]),
    female = n_distinct(dlc_id[sex == "F"])
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("male", "female"), names_to = "gender", values_to = "siblings") %>%
  group_by(taxon, common_name, gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    min = quantile(siblings, probs = 0.25),
    median = median(siblings),
    max = quantile(siblings, probs = 0.75)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(common_name = factor(common_name, levels = factor_levels)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(median, common_name)) +
  geom_crossbar(aes(xmin = min, xmax = max, fill = gender), position = "dodge2") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "male" = male_color,
    "female" = female_color
  )) +
  facet_wrap(~ common_name, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1) + 
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, label = image_labels) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = NULL) + 
  labs(title = "Offspring") +

    plot.title = element_textbox(color = text_color, hjust = 0.5, size = 16),
    axis.text.y = element_markdown(hjust= 0.5, color = text_color),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = grid_color),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),

    panel.background = element_rect(fill = panel_color),
    panel.border = element_blank()
  )
```

## Growth Rates

This graph averages the weight for each taxon at each month of age. Finding the average by day or by week was far too granular, as each timepoint had far too few samples to derive any meaningful pattern. Additionally, only infant and juvenile lemurs are plotted, as adult lemurs stop growing (duh), and as such reach a weight plateau. Finally, the y-axis scales are deliberately free because otherwise some of the smaller species (e.g., Gray Mouse Lemur) disappeared on the graph.

```{r Lemur Growth Rates, fig.height=14, fig.width=4}
# weight by age and taxon
## grouping by age_at_wt_d is far too granular   (One = 17792, Not One = 9336)
## grouping by age_at_wt_wk is less granular     (One =  3209, Not One = 7343)
## grouping by age_at_wt_mo is far less granular (One =   215, Not One = 2884)

max_age_at_concep <- lemurs %>%
  inner_join(taxon_map, by = "taxon") %>%
  filter(common_name == "Aye-Aye") %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean = (ceiling(mean(r_min_dam_age_at_concep_y)) * 12)) %>%
  pull(mean)

growth_rate_plot <- lemurs %>%
  inner_join(taxon_map, by = "taxon") %>%
  filter(
    age_category == "IJ", # there is a hard plateau in weight after this point
    sex != "ND",
    birth_institution == "Duke Lemur Center"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(round_age_mo = round(age_at_wt_mo)) %>%
  group_by(taxon, common_name, sex, round_age_mo) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight_g)) %>%
  ungroup()  %>%
  mutate(common_name = factor(common_name, levels = factor_levels)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(round_age_mo, mean_weight)) +
  geom_line(aes(color  = sex), size = 2) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(
    "M" = male_color,
    "F" = female_color
  )) +
  scale_x_continuous(name = NULL, breaks = seq(0, max_age_at_concep, 12), labels = function(x) ifelse(x/12 == 1, paste0(x/12, "yr"), paste0(x/12, "yrs"))) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = NULL, labels = function(x) paste0(x, "g")) +
  facet_wrap(~ common_name, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") + 
  labs(title = "Average Monthly Weight Until Maturity") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_textbox(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, color = text_color),
    axis.text = element_text(color = text_color),
    legend.position = "none",
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    strip.text.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = grid_color),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = grid_color, linetype = "dashed"),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = plot_color, color = plot_color),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = panel_color),
    panel.border = element_blank()
  )
```

## Weight at Adulthood

I could have found the median weight at the young adult `age_category`, but I figured this group might still be growing slightly and therefore may distort the resulting bar charts. Here the scales are shared in order to highlight that there is in fact a huge range between the smallest lemur taxons and the largest lemur taxons.

```{r plot3, fig.height=14, fig.width=4}
# geom text objects with 'avg weight at maturity' and 'avg age at maturity' by taxon
## maturity defined as min age at conception
## maybe break this down by gender as well?

## weight at sexual maturity
adult_weight_plot <- lemurs %>%
  inner_join(taxon_map, by = "taxon") %>%
  filter(
    age_category == "adult",
    birth_institution == "Duke Lemur Center"
  ) %>%
  group_by(common_name, sex) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    mean_weight = median(weight_g), 
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(common_name = factor(common_name, levels = factor_levels)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(mean_weight, common_name, group = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = sex), stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 1), color = text_color) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "M" = male_color,
    "F" = female_color
  )) + 
  geom_text(
    aes(label = ifelse(mean_weight < 1000, paste0(round(mean_weight), "g"), paste0(round(mean_weight / 1000, 2), "kg"))),
    position = position_dodge(width = 1), hjust = -0.1, color = text_color, fontface = "bold", size = 3
  ) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = NULL, limits = c(0, 5000), labels = function(x) ifelse(x == 0, paste0(x, "kg"), paste0(x/1000, "kg"))) +
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, labels = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~ common_name, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") + 
  labs(
    title = "Adult Weight",
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_textbox(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, color = text_color),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = grid_color),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = text_color),
    legend.position = "none",
