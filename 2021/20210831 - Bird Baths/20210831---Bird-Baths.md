## What are the most populous birds?

``` r
bird_counts <- bird_baths %>%
  group_by(bird_type) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(bird_count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) 

# bird_counts %>%
#   ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(bird_type, total), total)) + 
#   geom_hline(yintercept = 300) + 
#   geom_point() + 
#   scale_x_discrete(name = NULL, labels = NULL)

most_populous_birds <- bird_counts %>%
  filter(total > 300) %>%
  pull(bird_type)
```

## Which birds had the biggest raw change from Urban to Rural?

Looks like thereâ€™s a fairly decent breaking point around 300 birds
total.

## Which birds had the biggest raw change from 2014 to 2015?

For either urban and / or rural.

## Ideas from Cleary et al 2016

### Do assemblages at urban and rural bird baths differ across bioregions?

Use
[PERMANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutational_analysis_of_variance),
which can be found in the `vegan` and `InPerm` packages.

### Do assemblages at urban and rural bird baths differ within bioregions?

[Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) ordination
techniques](http://strata.uga.edu/8370/lecturenotes/multidimensionalScaling.html)
found in library `vegan` and PERMANOVA

### Is species richness different at bird baths in rural areas compared to urban areas?
