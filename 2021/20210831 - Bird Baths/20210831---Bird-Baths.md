# Introduction

# Exploratory Data Analysis

``` r
# libraries
library(forcats)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
# data
bird_baths <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-08-31/bird_baths.csv')

## view dataset
bird_baths %>%
  head()

## What are the most populous birds?

``` r
bird_counts <- bird_baths %>%
  group_by(bird_type) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(bird_count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) 

# bird_counts %>%
#   ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(bird_type, total), total)) + 
#   geom_hline(yintercept = 300) + 
#   geom_point() + 
#   scale_x_discrete(name = NULL, labels = NULL)

most_populous_birds <- bird_counts %>%
  filter(total > 300) %>%
  pull(bird_type)

most_populous_birds
```

    ##  [1] "Noisy Miner"       "Australian Magpie" "Rainbow Lorikeet" 
    ##  [4] "Red Wattlebird"    "Superb Fairy-wren" "Magpie-lark"      
    ##  [7] "Pied Currawong"    "Crimson Rosella"   "Eastern Spinebill"
    ## [10] "Spotted Dove"

## Which birds had the biggest raw change from Urban to Rural?

Looks like thereâ€™s a fairly decent breaking point around 300 birds
total.

## Which birds had the biggest raw change from 2014 to 2015?

For either urban and / or rural.

Overall change (ignoring urban / rural and bioregion) shows the
following reductions from 2014

``` r
bird_baths %>%
  filter(!(is.na(survey_year))) %>%
  group_by(bird_type, survey_year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    total = sum(bird_count)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "survey_year", values_from = "total", names_prefix = "survey_") %>%
  mutate(delta = survey_2015 - survey_2014) %>%
  arrange(delta) %>%
  head(10)
```

## Ideas from Cleary et al 2016

### Do assemblages at urban and rural bird baths differ across bioregions?

Use
[PERMANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutational_analysis_of_variance),
which can be found in the `vegan` and `InPerm` packages.

### Do assemblages at urban and rural bird baths differ within bioregions?

[Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) ordination
techniques](http://strata.uga.edu/8370/lecturenotes/multidimensionalScaling.html)
found in library `vegan` and PERMANOVA

### Is species richness different at bird baths in rural areas compared to urban areas?
