# Introduction

This weeks [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-07-13) dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete) by way of manual data aggregation from [plummye](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman).

> Every Scooby-Doo episode and movie's various variables.
>
> Took ~1 year to watch every Scooby-Doo iteration and track every variable. Many values are subjective by nature of watching but I tried my hardest to keep the data collection consistent.
>
> If you plan to use this data for anything school/entertainment related you are free to (credit is always welcome).

The average Scooby Doo TV series has `r mean(count(season_info, series_name)$n)` seasons. That's so few!

```{r scooby season imdb timeline}
# plot season over time
season_info %>%

    type = 'bar',
    mode = 'markers',
    x = ~season_id,
    y = ~mean_imdb,
    color = ~ranking,
    colors = color_scheme1,
    text = ~paste0("<b>", series_name, " - Season ", season, "</b><br>",
                   "<i>Aired from ", season_start, " to ", season_end, " on ", network, "</i><br><br>",
                   "Mean IMDb Score: ", round(mean_imdb, 2), " (Number of Reviews: ", round(mean_engagement), ")<br>",
                   "Episodes: ", n_episodes, "<br>")
  ) %>%
  layout(
