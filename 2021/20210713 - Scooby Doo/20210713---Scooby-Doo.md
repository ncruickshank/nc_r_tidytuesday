# Introduction

This weeks [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-07-13) dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete) by way of manual data aggregation from [plummye](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman).

> Every Scooby-Doo episode and movie's various variables.
>
> Took ~1 year to watch every Scooby-Doo iteration and track every variable. Many values are subjective by nature of watching but I tried my hardest to keep the data collection consistent.
>
> If you plan to use this data for anything school/entertainment related you are free to (credit is always welcome).
