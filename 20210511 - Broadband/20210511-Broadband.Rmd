# Introduction

![Broabd Image from NATaT](http://www.natat.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/broadband.jpg)

This weeks analysis comes from the [R Tidy Tuesday Community 2021-05-11](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-05-11) project, which featured data provided by [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages) and [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data) on broadband data by country in America.  
  
> If broadband access was a problem before 2020, the pandemic turned it into a crisis. As everyday businesses moved online, city council meetings or court proceedings became near-inaccessible to anyone whose connection couldn’t support a Zoom call. Some school districts started providing Wi-Fi hotspots to students without a reliable home connection. In other districts, kids set up in McDonald’s parking lots just to get a reliable enough signal to do their homework. After years of slowly widening, the broadband gap became impossible to ignore.  

# Tidy Data

```{r}
latlong <- geocode_zip(broadband_zip$postal_code)

## broadband
bd <- broadband %>%
  rename(c(
    "state" = "st",
    "fips" = "county_id"
    )) %>%
  mutate(
    group = 1,
    broadband_category = case_when(
      broadband_usage <= 0.1 ~ "<= 10%",
      broadband_usage < 0.9 ~ "> 10% and < 90%",
      broadband_usage >= 0.9 ~ ">= 90%"
    )
  )

## broadband zip
bz <- broadband_zip %>%
  rename(c(
    "zipcode" = "postal_code",
    "state" = "st",
    "fips" = "county_id"
    )) %>%
  mutate(
    zipcode = as.character(zipcode),
    group = 1,
    broadband_category = case_when(
      broadband_usage <= 0.1 ~ "<= 10%",
      #broadband_usage < 0.9 ~ NULL,
      broadband_usage >= 0.9 ~ ">= 90%"
    )
    ) %>%
  left_join(latlong)
```

# Broadband Distribution by Country

For the primary data source, I decided to do a slight twist on [The Verge's](https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data) plot. I elected to highlight counties with less than 10% broadband usage _and_ counties with greater than 90% broadband usage. While including the ">= 90%" group provides an additional layer to the graph, it does not suggest any interesting patterns. There are very few counties that fall into this group, and those that do appear to be scattered rather than clustered.

```{r broadband_choropleth, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
bd_map <- bd %>%
  select(fips, broadband_category)

broadband_map <- plot_usmap(regions = "counties", data = bd_map, values = "broadband_category", color = "navy", size = 0.1) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  labs(
    title = "Broadband Internet Access in America by County (as of October 2020)",
    fill = "Percent of people per county using broadband speed internet"
  ) + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue1"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue1")
    )

broadband_map
```

# Comparing Broadband Access to Census Data

Next I decided to briefly explore what features may help predict county broadband usage. Some quick research led to an [article by Reddick et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480260/) which suggests that features such as __population size__ and __socio-economic status__ (among others) may contribute to broadband access. These features are readily available through [census data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).

```{r}
key <- as.character(read.delim("census_api_key.txt", header = FALSE)$V1)
census_api_key(key)

#v19 <- load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
```

## Population by County

```{r}
census_pop <- get_acs(geography = "county",
                  variables = c(total_pop = "B01003_001"),
                  year = 2019) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

pop_map <- census_pop %>%
  rename(c(
    "fips" = "geoid",
    "total_pop" = "estimate"
  )) %>%
  mutate(
    pop_category = case_when(
      total_pop < 250000 ~ "0 - 250k",
      total_pop < 500000 ~ "250k - 500k",
      total_pop < 750000 ~ "500k - 750k",
      total_pop < 1000000 ~ "750k - 1000k",
      total_pop >= 1000000 ~ "More Than 1000k+",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(fips, pop_category)
```

### Choropleth

```{r population_choropleth, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
pop_map <- plot_usmap(regions = "counties", data = pop_map, values = "pop_category", color = "navy", size = 0.1) + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + 
  labs(
    title = "Estimated population per county in 2019",
    fill = "Binned Population Size"
  ) + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue3"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue3"),
    plot.margin = unit(c(0, 0, 0, 0), "cm")
  )

```

### Linear Model to Predict Broadband Usage by County Population

```{r lm_bd_pop}
census_pop_join <- census_pop %>%

  mutate(fips = as.double(fips)) %>%
  select(fips, name, total_pop)

max_pop <- max(census_pop_join$total_pop)

bd_pop <- bd %>% 
  left_join(census_pop_join) %>%
  mutate(
    broadband_usage = as.double(broadband_usage),
    scale_pop = round(total_pop / max_pop, 4)
  ) %>%
  filter(!(is.na(scale_pop)))

# make the linear model
bd_pop_model <- lm(broadband_usage ~ scale_pop, data = bd_pop)

## get equation
bd_pop_model_intercept <- as.double(coef(bd_pop_model)["(Intercept)"])
