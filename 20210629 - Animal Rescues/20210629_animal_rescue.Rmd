# Introduction

Data this week comes from [London.gov](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb). 

> Fox in bedroom, dog trapped in wall. The London Fire Brigade responds to hundreds of requests to rescue animals each year. Its monthly-updated spreadsheet of such events goes back to 2009; it lists the location and type of property, the kind of animal and rescue, hours spent, a (very) brief description, and more.

Another [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/08/animal-rescues-london-fire-brigade-rise-2020-pandemic-year) found that animals rescues increased by 20% in the year of the pandemic (2020). 

> The London fire brigade (LFB) was involved in 755 such incidents â€“ more than two a day. The number of rescues rose by 20% compared with 2019 when there were 602, with the biggest rise coming in the number of non-domestic animals rescued, according to the data.
