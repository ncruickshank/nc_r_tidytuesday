Information regarding the Tidy Tuesday project can be found at [this Github repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-06-08). The data comes from the [Great Lakes Fishery Commission](http://www.glfc.org/great-lakes-databases.php). Full detailson the data can be found on their [static notes](http://www.glfc.org/commercial/COMMERCIAL%20FISH%20PRODUCTION_Notes%20on%20Statistics.pdf) and [background notes](http://www.glfc.org/commercial/COMMERCIAL%20FISH%20PRODUCTION_background.pdf).

> Commercial fish catch data (called production) were published by the Great Lakes Fishery Commission in 1962 (Technical Report No.3) and covered the period 1867-1960. A supplement covering the years 1961-1968 was released in 1970, and a revised edition covering the years 1867-1977 was published in 1979. This third update of a web-based version covers the period 1867-2015. The intent is to update at approximately five-year intervals. The files are intended for open use by the public. We ask only that the commission be acknowledged when these records are used in presentations and publications.

# Tidying the datasets and exploratory analysis

knitr::kable(head(fishing),
             align = 'c',
             caption = "First six rows of the fishing dataset")
```


Why are "Total Canada (ONT)", "U.S. Total (MI)", and others included in this dataset?

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=8}
fishing %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    sum_grand_total = sum(grand_total, na.rm = TRUE),
    sum_values = sum(values, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(category = ifelse(str_detect(region, "Total"), "total", "not total")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(region, sum_values), sum_values)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = category), stat = "identity") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(
    title = "Why are there 'total' regions in the dataset?",
    subtitle = "Are there double counts?",
    x = ""
  ) + 
  theme(
    legend.position = "none"
  )
```

I think we can cut the following regions: 'U.S. Total', 'Canada (ONT)', 'WI State Total', 'MI State Total', and 'U.S. Total (MI)'. 'Total Canada (ONT)' looks like a fishy name (pun intended), but the actual count looks more legitimate than 'Canada (ONT)'.  

Preliminary exploratory analysis revealed that the species "cisco" and "chub" were sometimes combined to "cisco and chub" or "cisco and chubs". Easiest way to handle this was to just combine all instances of "cisco" and "chub" into the overarching group "cisco and "chub" (as well as unifying the pluralization). This phase of the project also revealed that the `lake` Saint Clair was vastly underrepresented in the `fishing` dataset. Further, it kind of throws off the narrative of comparing the five great lakes. As such, it was filtered out.

```{r}
# tidy daya
fish_df <- fishing %>%
  filter(
    lake != "Saint Clair"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    species = str_to_lower(species),
    species = ifelse(species %in% c("chubs", "cisco", "cisco and chubs"), "cisco and chub", species)
  )

fishing_top_species_df <- fish_df %>%
  group_by(lake, species) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    sum_values = sum(values, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  top_n(5, sum_values) %>%
  arrange(lake, desc(sum_values)) 

top_fish_list <- unique(fishing_top_species_df$species)
