# Introduction

This weeks [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-07-13) dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete) by way of manual data aggregation from [plummye](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman).

> Every Scooby-Doo episode and movie's various variables.
>
> Took ~1 year to watch every Scooby-Doo iteration and track every variable. Many values are subjective by nature of watching but I tried my hardest to keep the data collection consistent.
>
> If you plan to use this data for anything school/entertainment related you are free to (credit is always welcome).

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## IMDB Score Over Time

```{r}
series_dates <- scoobydoo %>%
  mutate(year = year(date_aired)) %>%
  group_by(series_name) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    series_start = min(date_aired),
    series_end = max(date_aired)
  )
```


```{r}
scooby_imdb_seasons <- scoobydoo %>%
  mutate(imdb = as.double(imdb)) %>%
  group_by(series_name, season) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    episodes = n(),
    mean_imdb = mean(imdb, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(
    episodes > 1,
    !(is.na(mean_imdb))
    ) %>%
  left_join(series_dates) %>%
  arrange(series_start)

plot_ly(scooby_imdb_seasons, x = ~series_start) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~mean_imdb, name = 'trendline', mode = 'markers') %>%
  #add_ribbons(xmin = ~series_start, xmax = ~series_end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, color = ~series_name) %>%

    yaxis = list(title = "Mean IMDb Score")
  )
