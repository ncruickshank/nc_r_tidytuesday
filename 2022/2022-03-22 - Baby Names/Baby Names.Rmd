## Visualization

Change in length of name length (number of characters) over time. 

Lessons Learned: Max char_count by year and sex winds up being a meaningless (no change) story.

```{r}
bn <- babynames %>%
  mutate(char_count = str_length(name)) %>%
  group_by(year, sex, char_count) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n2 = sum(n)) %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    avg_name_length = weighted.mean(x = char_count, w = n2)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() 

bn %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, avg_name_length)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = sex)) + 
  labs(title = "Average name length dramatically increased in the 1980s")
```
